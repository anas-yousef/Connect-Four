I discussed the exercise with: Mohamad Ektelat
=============================
  README for ex12 : Four in a row
=============================


====================

Description : This homework contains a new topic. It talks about connecting between two human players
connecting between two computers or connecting between a human and computer. The homework
split into three sections; The first section was to build a board (6x7),  putting the disks in the board associated
with the player's turn and checking whether there is a winner or not. The second section was about
to connect between two human players; In this section we used the ip of the computer and the port,
we used the class Communicator to invoke the connection with the server and the client to initialize a game 
between them and see who wins. The last section consisted of two computer's playing against each other
by picking random columns every turn and hope for a winner.

==================

======================
Special Comments: To be honest, it was one of the best and most challenging projects we have ever done.
We learnt new skills and the idea itself to connect between a server and a client is just fascinating. Hope you
find our code and game fun.

Changes in the resubmission:
1) Added some documentation to functions and lines that were not clear
2) In lines 44-47, I corrected the condition where we needed to change between the server and the client
